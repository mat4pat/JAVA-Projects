  This is a little testing after first NumberRandomizer project.
  
  Both of the classes need to be imported, or be in the same package, my package's name was 'mat4pat'.
  I've added a feature to determine maximum number range for randomizer by seeing how many objects were created,
  the minimum number range for randomizer would be determined by user input.
  
  Of course, for simplicity, you could decide to just create the objects inside the original class,
  NumberRandomizer, instead of class CreateObjectsHere, however I'm new and I like to test the modifiers, and see how OOP works.
