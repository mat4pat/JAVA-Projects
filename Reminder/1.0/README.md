Hello, this is my Java reminder.

To call it a reminder would be a lie, however it is some sort of 'diary' -
you may store, view and delete as much work as you wish.
Your work has two attributes, notes and deadline(in my code it's only one attribute :P)

To make this reminder work, you need to have the src folder in a project file,
later compile all the .java files and run ExecuteReminder.jar.
If you forget Work.txt, it will be created automatically if you forget it.

I believe I explained most of my code at good detail while trying to keep it fairly short,
suggestions, feedback and questions are always welcome.
